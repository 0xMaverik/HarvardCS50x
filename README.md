# HarvardCS50x

My projects from Harvard's CS50x Online Course. Taken Feb 2022 - May 2022.

Prior to taking this course, I've had limited experience with programming. I have done a little HTML/CSS and launched a small website for a friend of mine utilizing an iframe to display his NFT Tracking Spreadsheet.

I also have limited experience with JavaScript but plan to pick it back up after completing this course.

I have included all of the final products as well as a couple of WIPs.
